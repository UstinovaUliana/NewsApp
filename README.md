# News App

This application receives the latest news from the server, displays it on the screen and saves it to the database. Also it allows user to search through the news using the search bar.
For this app I've used https://newsapi.org/ API.

## Technology stack
Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Coroutines, Retrofit + okHttp, Hilt, Room.
